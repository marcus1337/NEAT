# NEAT

Interface with the code is done via "Coordinator.h". "Main.h" and "Test.h" are not ment to exist in a final solution.

### Purpose
Uses a genetic algorithm to train neural networks. All networks being trained have the same number of input and output nodes, which are
defined by "numIn" and "numOut". The amount of networks that are to be trained at once are defined by "numAI".
